# MatchGameKnockout
This is a port of *MatchGame* from JQuery to KnockoutJS.

Play a game [here](https://oopfan.github.io/MatchGameKnockout/public/)

* This app uses KnockoutJS version 3.4.2 with which I have a good deal of
  experience.
* The original MatchGame project with Codecademy was coded in JQuery. I had
  fun porting it to other frameworks: React, Angular, and now Knockout.
* The original project had just one instance of the game. Going forward
  I will make two instances on the same page that can be played simultaneously.
